# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains the code for a predictive model aimed at detecting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. The model has been deployed as a live web application using **Streamlit**, enabling users to interact with the application and visualize predictions in real-time.

## 📝 Project Overview

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. This project utilizes machine learning to predict the risk of heart disease based on various physiological and lifestyle factors, such as age, cholesterol levels, and physical activity. It serves as a valuable tool for healthcare professionals and individuals to assess potential heart disease risks and take preventive actions.

### ⚙️ Key Features:
- **🧠 Machine Learning Model**: Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user inputs, such as medical history, lifestyle habits, and more.
- **🌐 Streamlit Web Application**: A simple and intuitive interface to input data and visualize the prediction results in real-time.
- **📊 Data Visualization**: Visualizes key metrics, risk factors, and prediction probabilities for better understanding.
- **💡 Healthcare Insight**: Provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to heart disease risk.
